The Odin Project  - Landing Page
This is an assignment within the The Odin Project requiring me to create a landing page of an website.
The landing_page is meant to utilize the knowledge I acquired related to basics of HTML and CSS and the usage of flexbox within CSS.


The ./goal.png illustrates the page I am striving to create
while ./colors-and-fonts.png gives me reference fonts and color I should utilize within the page.
